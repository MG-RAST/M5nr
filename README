M5NR - A comprehensive non-redundant protein database

The M5NR is an integration of many sequence databases into one single, searchable database (plus an index). A single similarity search (using BLAST or BLAT) will allow the user to retrieve similarities to several databases (e.g. NCBI’s nr, KEGGs database or the EGGnogs — see below for a complete list).

Computing of sequence similarity results is becoming a limiting factor in metagenome analysis. Sequence similarity search results encoded in an open, exchangeable format distributed with the sequence sets have the potential to limit the needs for computational re-analysis of data sets. A prerequisite for sharing of similarity results is a common reference.

M5nr mechanisms are used for automatically maintaining this comprehensive non-redundant protein database and creating a quarterly release of this resource. In addition we present tools for translating similarity searches into many namespaces e.g. KEGG or NCBI’s GenBank.

M5 is a Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) initiative.
